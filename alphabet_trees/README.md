## Instructions

> 1. Write a class that creates an `AlphabetTree` of any size or length. (Nodes do not have to be unique.)
> 2. Add a method to the class which accepts another alphabet tree, compares the data of the two trees and prints all the unique letters within the two trees, in alphabetical order.
> 3. Write unit tests for the code.

## How to run

You can edit the `main` in the file `lib/alphabet_trees.dart` then run the command `dart run` from the root folder.

## Unit tests

All unit tests can be found in the `test/` folder, you can run the command `dart test` to check if they all pass correctly. The coverage has been generated using the package [test_coverage](https://pub.dev/packages/test_coverage).
